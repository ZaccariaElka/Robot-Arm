# Robot-Arm
The process of building my own Robotic arm using my own sources (Codes, 3D models, etc.). Everything will be documented available for everyone.

## Initial Design
So, I started with the design of the robotic arm drawing a simple sketch showing how the arm should mainly look.
The design will change over time but this will give us a quick overview of it.

After a few tries a came out with a simple design and more ideas for the arm.
This image will be my inspiration for the initial 3D model of the arm.
