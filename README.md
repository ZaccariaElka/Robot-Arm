# Robot-Arm
The process of building my own Robotic arm using my own sources (Codes, 3D models, etc.). Everything will be documented available for everyone.

## Initial Design

So, I started with the design of the robotic arm drawing a simple sketch showing how the arm should mainly look.
The design will change over time but this will give us a quick overview of it.

After a few tries a came out with a simple design and more ideas for the arm.
This image will be my inspiration for the initial 3D model of the arm.

This is the render of the base model for the robot arm. It does not have any mechanics yet, but they will be added after i will finalize all the shapes and measurements.

After testing the efficiency of the robotic arm i decided to make a redesign. I want it to look great and work well.

I came up with this simple design, that will rotate around 4/5 axis. I will later have to test the movements.
